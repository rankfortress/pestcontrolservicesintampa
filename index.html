	<p>
	When our phones ring, we realize you have a situation you want taken care of. We never act as though you’re interrupting our work, like some companies do.We all know a client’s first impression with a new company starts with the very first contact, which is why you’ll always hear a friendly, happy, live person answering your calls.You’ll never have to push “one for this”, “two for that” or “three for whatever” for a situation you need resolved. I personally hate going through that nonsense when I call places, and I’m sure you do too.After a while you’ll feel like you’re calling a good friend, as we know most of our clients on a first-name basis. A lot of our clients use multiple services and have been served by the same team for over ten years, some even from the very beginning of Chet’s Pest over 30 years ago.We always give you a reminder call for each appointment and follow up to make sure you’re thrilled with your service. If not, we do what it takes to make you happy.
